# SingleCell_BMTK

1.Download VM from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2.Download the CompNeuro Virtual Appliance provided by the Mizzou Neural Engineering Lab: https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-9tUHcFvi5LpnII8Zdzsfv8ZObdEwAUl This file is 8.6GB and will take some time to download. The file may also be available via USB.

3.download model from allen Database http://celltypes.brain-map.org, replace the morphology(.swc), modfiles and parameter_fit.json to the source floder.

4.compile the modfiles in sources floder, use the command nrnivmodl modfiles and generate the x86_64, move x86_64 to the sources floder

5.run the notebook, you can change any conductances values or injeted current current amplitudeï¼Œdelay time and duration time.

6.If you want to test another sets of inputs or conductances, just click the kernel button and select restart l& run all.
